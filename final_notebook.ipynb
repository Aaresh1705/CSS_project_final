    "We have decided to look into the local musician communities in Denmark where we will look into the amount of overlap there is of musicians across bands. We will be looking into two overlapping networks, one where musicians connect to musicians and another with groups connect to other groups. This will be done by constructing a bipartite group-member network where musicians linked by common groups and groups linked by common musicians.\n",
