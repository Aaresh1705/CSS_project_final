    "\n",
    "In our network analysis, we will mainly focus on the Danish Music Groups (DMG) projection of the network connected by common musicians to narrow the scope and enable a more in-depth exploration. The musicians network has an interpretation problem as nodes with a high degree are hard to interpret. High-degree musicians can both be associated with multiple music groups or just be a musician of a very large music group (ex a symphony orchestra). This is also an influence in the DMG projection, however here a group also has to share musicians with other groups to create a link and thereby the large music groups does not automatically create many links. Lastly, very few musicians (of famous bands even) donâ€™t have a wikipedia article, although fairly unknown bands have. Thereby it is natural to focus on music groups, which also will be the focus of our text analysis."
