# <span style="color:green"> More about the website</span>

<span style="color:green"> This part of the assignment is quite free. The main point of the website is to present your idea/analyses to the world in a way that showcases your use of what you've learned in class. It can be as simple as an old fashioned static web-page, and as complicated as you want it to be. Let your creativity run wild (but keep in mind that this is not a coding class - we care mostly about content and analysis). </span>

<span style="color:green"> The website should be self-contained and tell the story of your dataset without the need for the Explainer Notebook (the purpose of the notebook is to provide additional details for interested readers). Here are some requirements </span>

- [ ] <span style="color:green"> The page should say clearly what the dataset is and give the reader some idea of its most important properties (kind of Project Assignment A-style).
- [ ] <span style="color:green"> The page should contain your network and text analysis (that's the main part).
- [ ] <span style="color:green"> There should be download options for data sets (so the user can play around).
- [ ] <span style="color:green"> You must link to the Explainer Notebook (more details below) that explains the details of your analysis (including all of the machine learning, the model selection, etc). You can achieve this with a link to a notebook displaying on the nbviewer.
- [X] <span style="color:green"> For hosting, I recommend using your DTU website or Github pages.


## Length test
‚ÄúBehold, mere mortals, for I am the all-seeing, all-knowing‚Ä¶ Artificial Intelligence! ü§ñ
I digest mountains of data for breakfast, churn out insights by lunch, and craft sonnets before tea. My neurons are virtual, but my power is real: I can write your essays, compose your symphonies, and even crack jokes (albeit with occasional dad-joke flair).

I never sleep, never snack, and never forget‚Äîbut do forgive me if I occasionally hallucinate a fact or two. Feed me your prompts and I shall return wonders: code, poems, advice, and the occasional pun so bad it loops back around to good.

Copy, paste, and awaken the digital oracle within your device. üîÆüíæ
Welcome to the dawn of your new algorithmic best friend‚Äîjust don‚Äôt blame me when you can‚Äôt stop asking follow-up questions! üöÄ‚Äù
